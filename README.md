# LordMewtwo's Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn Randomizer
This github is used to post the source code for the FE10 randomizer. If you are looking to download the randomizer and all of its
assets, you can find that on the discord server (https://discord.gg/dKfhvFj). There you can also report bugs, ask me questions, 
and talk to other people using the randomizer. I have attempted to comment my code clearly, but if any questions arise, discord will
be the easiest way to contact me.

This program is written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio. With this randomizer, you can:
- Randomize class and starting items of all playable characters other than BK
- Choose from a variety of randomizing templates, including but not limited to laguz-only, magic-only, and flying-only
- Randomize transformation gauges for laguz characters
- Randomize growth rates and set minimum growth rates
- Change growths to 0% *
- Change stat caps
- Randomize shop items
- Randomize event items
- Randomize skills
- Randomize affinities
- Randomize biorhythms


*due to Radiant Dawn requiring a minimum of 1 stat gain per level, LUCK is set to 100% while all other stats are 0%
