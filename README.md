# LordMewtwo's Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn Randomizer
This github is used to post the source code for the FE10 randomizer. If you are looking to download the randomizer and all of its
assets, you can find that on the discord server (https://discord.gg/dKfhvFj). There you can also report bugs, ask me questions, 
and talk to other people using the randomizer. I have attempted to comment my code clearly, but if any questions arise, discord will
be the easiest way to contact me.

This program is written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio. You can view the code in Form1.cs

With this randomizer, you can:
- Randomize class and starting items of all playable characters other than BK
- Change recruitment order, including being able to play as a handful of enemy characters
- Randomize or shuffle growth rates and set minimum growth rates
- Change growths to 0%
- Add back in the dumb changes made to Hardmode like removing weapon triangle and enemy ranges
- Change stat caps
- Randomize enemies and bosses
- Power up enemies and give them random skills
- Randomize shop, bargain, and forge items
- Randomize event items
- Randomize skills
- New QoL and difficulty settings such as Ironman mode, Choose my Tower, no FoW, Horse Parkour, and more!
- Randomize affinities, biorhythm, transformation gauges, movement, and so much more!
