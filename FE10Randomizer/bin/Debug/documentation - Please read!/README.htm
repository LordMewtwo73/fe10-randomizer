    <p>
        Thank you for downloading my randomizer! The goal of this
        document is to minimize the confusion of users, so here you
        will find detailed instructions regarding the use of the randomizer,
        as well as descriptions of each aspect of the game that the
        randomizer is capable of modifying.

    <p>
        Looking for a step-by-step process to make this randomizer go?
        You've come to the right place!
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Find an NTSC-U or PAL FE10 iso. I can't tell you where to find
            this, but the internet is your friend here. Once you have it, make
            sure it is a .iso file, not .nkit.iso or .wpf or anything else.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            Download and extract the randomizer. You can find it on the <a href="http://discord.gg/dKfhvFj">DISCORD</a> or on <a href="https://github.com/LordMewtwo73/fe10-randomizer">GITHUB</a>.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            Extract the contents of your iso into a directory using a program
            like WiiBaFu. If you have problems with WiiBaFu, and you're sure you
            have a .iso, check out the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> to see if the problem
            has been covered there.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            Open up the randomizer by running the .exe file in your downloaded
            randomizer folder.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            After extracting with WiiBaFu, you should have a collection of folders
            that contain all of the data of your iso. Inside of the extracted folder, there
            will be a folder named "DATA", and then within that folder there should be a
            folder named "files". (Note: in some versions of the game, there is no "DATA" folder.
            However, you should still have a "files" folder. Using the <i>Load Folder</i> button
            under <i>File</i> on the randomizer menu bar, select the "files" folder.
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b> after extracting my iso to my desktop, I would select
            the following folder with the randomizer: C:\Users\LordMewtwo73\Desktop\Fire
            Emblem Radiant Dawn [RFEE01]\DATA\files
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            Choose whatever settings you would like to modify with the randomizer.
            For a detailed explanation of each selection, check out the <a href="#details">How it Works</a> section of this document.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            Here you may choose to fully save your changes or not. If you select the checkbox named <i>Don't Save</i>, the randomizer will do all of its
            fancy math and calculations and spit out an outputlog for you to peruse. However, your ISO will be unchanged. This allows you to check the outputlog to
            make sure you like the final product before actually editing your files. If you use the same exact seed and settings (I recommend just not closing the
            randomizer), but you uncheck <i>Don't Save</i>, you will find that your randomized ISO will be identical to what your outputlog theorized.
            Whether you select that checkbox or not, click <i>Randomize</i> to begin the process!
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            If the previous steps were done correctly, the randomizer should run
            without issue and eventually say "Randomization complete!"
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            Use WiiBaFu to rebuild your iso from the extracted contents. Once again,
            if you come across problems with WiiBaFu, check out the FAQ.
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            Congratulations, you have a randomized FE10 iso! A new randomization will
            require a new save file, but you can start from a cleared save file just fine. Make sure
            your new game is either Normal or Hard mode, as the randomizer does not work with Easy mode!
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Class Randomization Options</h4>
    <p>
        <i>Basic</i> randomization keeps everybody as the same race even after class
        randomization. Using this function would prevent Sothe from becoming a Wolf, while
        simultaneously preventing Volug from being a Rogue.<br>When paired with random recruitment,
        the unit slot is instead kept the same race. (Example: Volug is now the unit recruited in
        1-2 instead of Sothe. Even though Volug is usually a laguz, he will be a beorc class due
        to the fact that the original character recruited there is a beorc unit.)
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Full</i> randomization removes the restrictions of its predecessor, and allows for
        a no-holds-barred class randomization.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rest of this dropdown contains a list of pre-weighted randomization "challenges"
        that usually restrict you to one or two types of classes.
        <br> <i>Basic</i> and <i>Full</i> allow you to customize the weights, which will
        be explained more in the next section.
    </p>
    <p>
        At default, this option randomizes 69 units. It does not randomize the three herons
        without a different checkbox being selected, and it does not randomize the playable BK.

        <h4>Weights</h4>
    <p>
        Class weights determine the probability of each character being randomized
        into that type of class. Each tier, from <i>None</i> to <i>More Likely</i>, increase
        the probability by a factor of 3 above the previous tier. We will discuss the calculations
        behind the program, and then detail what classes are contained in each classtype.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each classtype is weighted by the equation <b>W = 3<sup>x-1</sup></b>, where <i>x</i> equals
        the column number from 1(Less Likely) to 5(More Likely) (<i>None</i> sets <b>W = 0</b>). The program
        adds up all of the weights of each classtype to get a total, and then selects a random number from
        that total. Let's look at an example:
    </p>

    <img src="images/weights.png" alt="Weight Example">

    <p>
        In this example, Infantry is set to the 4th column, Mages and Cavalry are set to the 2nd column,
        Beasts is set to the 3rd column, and everything else is set to zero. We can calculate the weight
        of each type using the equation above:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Infantry: W = 3<sup>4-1</sup> = 27</li>
        <li>Mages: W = 3<sup>2-1</sup> = 3</li>
        <li>Cavalry: W = 3<sup>2-1</sup> = 3</li>
        <li>Beasts: W = 3<sup>3-1</sup> = 9</li>
        <li>Everything else: W = 0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The total weight is W<sub>tot</sub> = 27+3+3+9 = 42.</p>
    <p>Dividing each weight by the total will give the percentage chance of selection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Infantry: 27/42 = <b>64.3%</b></li>
        <li>Mages: 3/42 = <b>7.1%</b></li>
        <li>Cavalry: 3/42 = <b>7.1%</b></li>
        <li>Beasts: 9/42 = <b>21.4%</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With the 72-unit cast that is Radiant Dawn, on average you would have 46 infantry,
        5-6 mages, 5-6 cavalry, and 15-16 beast units.
    </p>

    <h4>Class Types</h4>
    <p>
        Each class within a classtype is equally weighted, so once the classtype has been
        chosen for a unit, that unit has an equal chance of changing into any of the classes
        within that type.
    </p>
    <p>Though unlisted, promoted classes are in the same classtype as their demoted version.</p>

    <h4>Shuffle Vanilla Classes</h4>
    <p>
        This selection will randomize all of your characters' classes, with one important caveat:
        the number of each class line will stay consistent with non-randomized Radiant Dawn. For example,
        you will only have one hero, five myrmidons, three herons, and so forth. The number of each class
        line is listed here:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 hero</li>
        <li>5 myrmidon*</li>
        <li>3 soldier*</li>
        <li>2 fighter</li>
        <li>3 archer</li>
        <li>2 thief*</li>
        <li>1 assassin</li>
        <li>1 sword armor</li>
        <li>2 lance armor</li>
        <li>1 axe armor</li>
        <li>2 sword knight</li>
        <li>3 lance knight*</li>
        <li>2 axe knight*</li>
        <li>1 bow knight</li>
        <li>3 pegasus knight</li>
        <li>1 queen</li>
        <li>2 dragonknight*</li>
        <li>2 fire mage*</li>
        <li>1 thunder mage</li>
        <li>2 wind mage</li>
        <li>1 light mage</li>
        <li>1 dark sage</li>
        <li>1 cleric</li>
        <li>3 priest*</li>
        <li>3 cat</li>
        <li>3 tiger</li>
        <li>3 lion</li>
        <li>3 hawk</li>
        <li>3 crow</li>
        <li>3 heron</li>
        <li>1 empress</li>
        <li>1 chancellor</li>
        <li>1 black dragon</li>
        <li>2 red dragon</li>
        <li>1 white dragon</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        * with LM73 Custom Class patch enabled, the following changes are made to
        this class pool:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 myrmidon -> dread fighter</li>
        <li>1 soldier -> lancer</li>
        <li>1 thief -> trickster</li>
        <li>2 lance knight -> thunder knight</li>
        <li>1 axe knight -> fire paladin</li>
        <li>1 dragonknight -> malig knight</li>
        <li>1 fire mage -> bartendress</li>
        <li>2 priest -> war monk</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Randomize Laguz Gauge</h4>
    <p>
        Probably the most obnoxious selection in the entire randomization, this is only
        recommended if you're willing to take the risk of your laguz units possibly becoming
        useless without fistfuls of <i>grass</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are four different ways the transformation gauge change. You can read about the
        differences on serenesforest <a href="https://serenesforest.net/radiant-dawn/classes/transformation/">HERE</a>. For each playable unit randomized into
        a laguz class, the program will select a random value between the selected minimum and maximum
        and set that as the transformation gauge change. It will do this four times, once for
        each of the four different changes.
    </p>

    <h4>Force Micaiah/Ike/Elincia's Class</h4>
    <p>
        These settings allow you to choose the starting class of the three main characters. Some selections
        may appear as "-". This means whatever class normally holds that spot is not currently allowed.
        These classes may be custom classes, which require you to select the Custom Class Patch, or otherwise
        classes that may cause softlocks without certain other checkboxes selected. The "Exceptions" section
        below lists the classes that Ike cannot be, for example, along with what selections allow him to
        become those classes.
    </p>

    <h4>Misc</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Include Herons</b> adds the heron class to the "Birds" classtype as well as adding the three
        heron characters to the list of playable characters to have their class randomized (total 72 without BK).
    </p>
    <p><b>Don't Randomize Lords</b> keeps Micaiah, Elincia, and Ike as their default classes.</p>
    <p><b>Don't Randomize Thieves</b> keeps Sothe and Heather as their default classes.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Prevent Part 1 Laguz</b> prevents any of the Dawn Brigade from becoming laguz classes due
        to them being able to trivialize that part of the game worse than Sothe already does. Only works with <i>Full</i>
        randomization.
    </p>


    <h4>Exceptions</h4>
    <p>
        There are a few exceptions to randomized classes, most of which have been implemented to prevent
        unwinnable situations, or "softlocks".
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ike and Ranulf cannot be mounted due to "The General's Hand"*</li>
        <li>Ike cannot be a magic unit due to his solo fight with BK**</li>
        <li>Ike also can't be a raven or rogue due to the STR cap being too low to kill BK**</li>
        <li>Ike, Micaiah, Sothe, Nephenee, and Brom cannot be herons</li>
        <li>Micaiah and Edward cannot both be priests at the same time</li>
        <li>There are a maximum of three herons per game</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When a user selects options that would force one of these situations, the unit instead will
        default to their vanilla class.
    </p>
    <p>
        *Ike and Ranulf can be mounted classes with the <b>Horse Parkour</b> setting under <b>Miscellaneous</b>.
        <br>**Ike can be magic/rogue/raven classes with the <b>Nerf BK</b> or <b>
            Ike Fights BK with the Power of
            Friendship
        </b> settings under <b>Miscellaneous</b>.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2 id="growths">Growths</h2>

    <h4>Random w/ Deviation</h4>
    <p>
        This selection will go through each of the eight growths for a unit and choose a random growth within a range
        calculated using the deviation. For each stat, you can choose a minimum to prevent the program from selecting a
        number lower than that. You can also select <b>Cap Growths</b> to prevent the program from selecting a higher number.
        An example:
    </p>

    <img src="images/vanillagrowths.png" alt="vanilla growths" style="width:600px;height:350px;"><img src="images/growthsettings.png" alt="randgrowth settings">
    <p>
        Here are Micaiah's vanilla growths and the randomization settings selected by the user. For each growth,
        the program calculates the minimum and maximum possible growths by subtracting and adding the deviation,
        min = vanilla-deviation, max = vanilla+deviation:
    </p>

    <img src="images/growthrange.png" alt="growthrange" style="width:600px;height:350px;">
    <p>
        Before the program selects values within these ranges, however, the selected minimums have to be taken
        into account. The user also selected a growth cap, so that limits some of her growths as well:
    </p>

    <img src="images/adjgrowthrange.png" alt="adjusted growthrange" style="width:600px;height:350px;">
    <p>So with the selected settings, Micaiah's growths are randomly chosen within the listed ranges.</p>

    <h4>Shuffle w/ Addition</h4>
    <p>
        Deviation will oftentimes makes your units wildly stronger or weaker than their vanilla counterparts.
        Contrastly, this selection keeps a unit's total growths constant, with a user-given addition if
        desired. Selecting <b>Set 15% Minimum</b> will prevent a unit's growths from being shuffled in a way
        that leaves them with an abyssmal growth, and similarly, <b>Set 100% Maximum</b> will prevent one of a
        unit's growths from being incredibly high and the rest very low.
    </p>

    <img src="images/vanillagrowths.png" alt="vanilla growths" style="width:600px;height:350px;">
    <br>
    <img src="images/shufflegrowths.png" alt="shuffled growths" style="width:600px;height:350px;">

    <p>
        <b>Prioritize Higher Str/Mag</b> will guarantee that the higher of the two offensive growths and personal bases will
        match the unit's class. For example, Micaiah randomized as a Fighter will have an 80% STR growth instead of
        her normal 80% MAG growth.
    </p>


    <hr>
    <h2 id="bases">Stats</h2>

    <p>
        If you are unaware of how unit base stats work in most FE games, I will discuss that briefly here.<bk>
            A unit's base stats are actually the addition of two different stats, their class' base stats + their
            personal base stats:
    </p>

    <table>

        <tr><td>Light Mage Bases</td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Micaiah Bases</td><td>-1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>-3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Micaiah Total</td><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Who had the bright idea to give Micaiah a -3 base in RES?</p>
    <br>

    <p>
        The randomizer alters a unit's personal bases, and they can be negative. If they are more negative than
        their class' base stat, a unit may start with negative bases. Though in-game it will look as though they
        have a stat of zero, upon level up they may gain a point in that stat but still stay at zero.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this reason, too high of a base deviation may create a scenario where the game is impossible to beat.
        You have been warned, so now I don't have to take responsibility, thanks.
    </p>

    <h4>Random w/ Deviation</h4>
    <p>
        Calculated in a similar way to random growths. The game uses the deviation to calculate the minimum and
        maximum possible bases of a unit, then chooses a random number between those values.
    </p>

    <img src="images/randbases.png" alt="random bases" style="width:600px;height:350px;">

    <p>By adding the base stats of the Light Mage class, we can calculate her possible total base stats:</p>

    <table>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>HP</th><th>ATK</th><th>MAG</th><th>SKL</th><th>SPD</th><th>LCK</th><th>DEF</th><th>RES</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Light Mage Bases</td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Micaiah Bases</td><td>(-3)-1</td><td>0-4</td><td>1-5</td><td>1-5</td><td>0-4</td><td>8-12</td><td>(-1)-3</td><td>(-5)-(-1)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Micaiah Total</td><td>13-17</td><td>0-4</td><td>5-9</td><td>6-10</td><td>5-9</td><td>8-12</td><td>0-4</td><td>2-6</td></tr>
    </table>


    <h4>Shuffle w/ Addition</h4>
    <p>
        This selection will keep the total base stats of a unit constant while randomizing each stat. Unless
        <b>add HP and LCK to pool</b> is selected, it will only modify six stats. This is because a unit's
        HP and LCK bases are usually much higher, so adding those to the pool has the possibility of making
        otherwise reasonable characters extremely strong.
    </p>

    <p>Micaiah's personal base stats add up to a total of 17. If you shuffle base stats, here are some possible outcomes:</p>

    <img src="images/shufflebases.png" alt="shuffled bases" style="width:600px;height:350px;">

    <img src="images/hplckbases.png" alt="shuffled hplckbases" style="width:600px;height:350px;">
    <p>NOTE: The shuffling process restricts negative bases, so each shuffled base will be at least 0.</p>

    <h4>Class Base Stats</h4>
    <p>
        Class bases can be randomized in the same ways that personal bases can, so I won't go into detail
        again. If you haven't read the personal base stat section yet, it's right above this section.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only difference is that the LCK stat for classes is always set to zero, so the shuffle option
        completely disregards luck entirely.
    </p>


    <h4>Set Stat Caps</h4>
    <p>
        This selection will change the stat caps of each class in the game, allowing player (and enemy) units to
        grow well past where the original game intended. The downside of higher caps is removing the ability to
        BEXP abuse, due to the rarity of a unit capping any of their stats.
    </p>
    <p>No matter what you select here, the HP cap will be unshackled to 127 for all classes.</p>
    <h4>Random w/ Deviation</h4>
    <p>
        Instead of setting all stat caps to a selected value, this option lets you randomize stat caps
        similarly to how you would randomize growths or bases. Each stat cap is randomized to a value between
        its vanilla value +/- the selected deviation.
    </p>
    <h4>Flat Increase</h4>
    <p>
        This option will scale all stat caps up by the selected value. You should use this if you want to
        unshackle stats while also keeping each class's unique stat spread.
    </p>
    <h4>Only Change T3 Caps</h4>
    <p>
        Pretty self-explanatory. Use this option with any of the three Stat Cap modifiers and only the final
        tiered classes will be affected. This includes transformed laguz.
    </p>
    <h4>Minimum Cap</h4>
    <p>Forces each random cap to be equal or greater than the specified value here.</p>

    <img src="images/lethe.png" alt="no caps" style="width:600px;height:350px;">
    <p>"Look at me, Cain. I am the Laguz Royal now."</p>

    <h4>Randomize Stat Boosters</h4>
    <p>
        This selection modifies the stat gains/losses due to stat boosting items like the Dragonshield or
        Talisman. The max and min changes are manually set, and the stat that increases, as well as the amount it
        increases, will be randomly selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Allow Changes in Multiple Stats does exactly as it says - a stat boosting item will now change up to
        three different stats at a time, each by a random amount between the minimum and maximum.
    </p>


    <hr>
    <h2 id="enemy">Enemies</h2>

    <h4>Randomize Generic Enemy/Ally Classes</h4>
    <p>
        These selections will change the classes of all red or yellow units in the game. Each unit will be individually randomized,
        unless you select the "1:1 Class Changing" option.
    </p>

    <p>Due to AI issues among other things, there are limitations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thieves are unchanged to keep confusion to a minimum, as they are able to open chests regardless of class</li>
        <li>Some flying units are unchanged if they spawn in impossible-to-reach locations (ie pegasus knights in 1-6)</li>
        <li>Tier1 units cannot change into laguz because they become nearly unbeatable</li>
        <li>
            Due to their AI not knowing how to transform, all beorc turned into laguz classes are considered feral ones,
            and will always stay transformed - <b>As of version 3.0.0, this is no longer the case</b>
        </li>
        <li>Allied laguz remain unchanged - <b>As of version 3.0.0, this is no longer the case</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>1:1 Class Changing</h4>
    <p>
        This selection will 1-to-1 change classes of enemy units on all chapters. By 1-to-1, I mean that
        every fighter on a chapter will randomize into the same class, and so forth. Two units who are originally the same class
        as each other will not randomize into two different classes. This does not include units on different chapters.
        For example, bandits in 1-1 may change into myrmidons, but bandits in 1-2 may become pegasus knights.
    </p>

    <h4>Include Spirits</h4>
    <p>
        This selection not only randomizes the spirits that you fight in the final chapters of the game, but also
        adds the three spirit classes to the list of possible classes the enemy can turn into in part 4.
    </p>

    <h4>Similar Classtype</h4>
    <p>
        Makes sure that the random enemies stay within the bounds of their vanilla class. For example, an enemy
        myrmidon may randomize into a soldier,fighter,archer,etc, while an enemy firemage may randomize
        into a windmage,lightmage,etc. The "types" that this selection follows are Infantry, Magic, Mounted,
        Armored, Flying(beorc), and Laguz
    </p>

    <h4>No Siege Tomes</h4>
    <p>Any enemy unit randomized into a magic class will be prevented from having meteor/bolting/etc.</p>

    <h4>Only Siege Tomes</h4>
    <p>
        Conversely, any enemy unit randomized into a magic class will <i>always</i> have meteor/bolting/etc.
        Since early siege tomes can create impossible scenarios, this change does not begin until part 3.
    </p>

    <h4>Don't Randomize Healers</h4>
    <p>
        Enemy and allied priests and bishops will not be modified in any way. Tier 1 units cannot be randomized
        into the priest class, and tier 2 units who are randomized into a bishop will be equipped with
        light magic instead of a staff.
    </p>

    <h4>Beorc can't be Laguz and Vice-Versa</h4>
    <p>
        There are some AI issues when Laguz enemies are changed into Beorc classes and vice-versa.
        This selection keeps random enemies within their default race, keeping a more balanced and
        intelligent enemy force than with full randomization.
    </p>


    <h4>Random Enemy Drops</h4>
    <p>
        Items that enemies are holding, but not equipped, are randomized. The guy that
        used to drop a vulnerary might drop Urvan, you never know!
    </p>
    <p>Some items only available when stolen are now changed to be droppable.</p>

    <h4>Each Enemy Drops an Item</h4>
    <p>
        Each enemy obtains a random item that they will drop upon death.
    </p>
    <p>Some items only available when stolen are now changed to be droppable.</p>

    <h4>Enemies can have Stronger Weapons</h4>
    <p>
        Each weapon type has a list of possible weapons based off of what chapter the enemy unit appears on. The list is
        contained in an Excel document can can be found in the documentation folder. This selection allows units to
        have the next tier of weapon that is normally not available to units on that chapter.
    </p>

    <h4>Part 4 Enemies have T3 Classes</h4>
    <p>
        Is this smart? No. Will this be a fun way to play? Also no. Did somebody ask for it anyway? Yup.
        Good luck, and have fun getting Impaled or Astra'd every other fight.
    </p>

    <h4>Increase Enemy Growths</h4>
    <p>
        In case you were not aware, enemies do not have personal base stats. Instead, the game takes their class
        bases, treating them as level 1 stats, and autolevels them up using averaged growths. This selection will
        increase those growths, which will increase the stats of higher-leveled enemies.
    </p>

    <h4>Randomize Boss Classes</h4>
    <p>
        This will randomize the class and weaponry of almost every boss in the game. The list of possible weapons
        is the same for generic enemies, but as a default bosses are considered to have the "stronger weapons" checkbox
        selected, so their weaponry can be one tier higher than generic enemies. Limitations include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ike, Lethe, Micaiah, and Sigrun are not randomized as bosses</li>
        <li>Laguz bosses are not randomized</li>
        <li>bosses cannot be randomized into laguz or spirit classes</li>
        <li>BK, Dheginsea, and Ashera are not randomized</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Increase Boss Stats</h4>
    <p>Increases the base stats of each non-playable boss in the game other than BK, Dheginsea, and Ashera.</p>
    <p>
        The change is made linearly over the course of the game, so early bosses will have a small base stat
        increase while late game bosses will have the entire increase selected by the user. The
        equation is <i><b>increase = [selected number]*bossnumber/totalbosses</b></i>, rounded up. The total
        number of bosses affected by this change is 35.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a selected value of 5, each boss will recieve
        the following buffs to all eight stats:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr><th>Number</th><th>Name</th><th>Stat Increase</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1-7</td><td>Pugo-Wystan</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8-14</td><td>Laverton-Maraj</td><td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>15-21</td><td>Tashoria-Callum</td><td>3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>22-28</td><td>Lombroso-Yuma</td><td>4</td></tr>
        <tr><td>29-35</td><td>Catalena-Levail</td><td>5</td></tr>
    </table>

    <br>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="weapon">Weapons</h2>
    <p>
        Weapon randomization is based off of a deviation, similar to growth or base randomization. The program
        will take the vanilla value of a weapon's MT,ACC,etc and add/subtract the user-specified deviation to get
        the range of possible values. Then the specified min and max of each stat is applied where necessary.
        If you do not want an aspect of weapons to change, you can leave the devation
        at zero and no changes will occur for that stat. Let's take a look at an example:
    </p>

    <img src="images/ironsword.png" alt="ironsword" style="width:600px;height:350px;"><img src="images/weapsettings.png" alt="weapon settings">
    <p>With these settings, the Iron Sword weapon in the game has the following stat ranges:</p>
    <img src="images/randironsword.png" alt="ironsword stat ranges" style="width:600px;height:350px;">

    <h4>Randomize Laguz Weapons</h4>
    <p>
        Without this setting, random weapons will only modify beorc weapons - swords, lances, etc.
        Laguz weapons are tied to two things, their class and their weapon level. For each laguz class, there
        are three weapons (A, S, and SS rank). For example, all tigers with A rank in strike will have the
        same weapon stats, regardless of who they are. If you randomize these weapons, there is no guarantee
        that the SS rank weapon will be stronger than the S or A rank, so this selection can be very risky.
    </p>

    <h4>Keep Rare Staves at Default Uses</h4>
    <p>
        With this selection, staves with a low number of uses (Sleep, Silence, Matrona, etc) will not have
        their number of uses modified when weapons are randomized. This can be helpful to prevent enemies from
        having 15-use Sleep staves and similar situations.
    </p>

    <h4>Keep Seige Weapons at Default Uses</h4>
    <p>
        Similar to the previous selection, this will prevent seige tomes and ballistae from having their
        number of uses modified. Though a 22 use Meteor tome sounds great, it can be a lot less fun when
        the enemy has them, too!
    </p>

    <h4>Make Florete Magic-Based</h4>
    <p>
        Florete will use MAG instead of STR for attack power, and is not a part of the weapon nor
        magic triangle.
    </p>
    <h4>Greil Merc Weapon Locks</h4>
    <p>
        This allows other units to use weapons normally locked to characters:
        <br>- Ettard, Florete are now A rank
        <br>- Amiti is now S rank
        <br>- Ragnell, Cymbeline are now SS rank
    </p>
    <h4>Dawn Brigade Weapon Locks</h4>
    <p>
        This allows other units to use weapons normally locked to characters:
        <br>- Thani is now D rank
        <br>- Caladbolg, Lughnasadh, Tarvos are now B rank (I spelled those without looking them up and
        I am very proud of myself)
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2 id="recruit">Characters</h2>

    <p>
        To understand random recruitment, it is important to make the distinction between a unit (Nolan)
        and a unit slot (unit you obtain in 1-1). When you randomize recruitment, some of the unit information
        will be taken from the new unit, while some will stay consistent to the slot, no matter who
        takes up that slot.
    </p>
    <p>The following are characteristics taken from the new unit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Face</li>
        <li>Description</li>
        <li>Affinity</li>
        <li>Growths</li>
        <li>Class (if otherwise unrandomized)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following are characteristics consistent with the unit slot:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Level</li>
        <li>Skills (if otherwise unrandomized)</li>
        <li>Events (win/lose conditions, killing Ashera, seizing, finding treasure, PRF weapons)</li>
        <li>Bases</li>
        <li>Special battle music</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Thus, the unit that replaces Ike is able to wield Ettard and Ragnell (if their class allows swords),
        and more importantly, must be the character to land the finishing blow on Ashera. Similarly, the unit
        that replaces Sothe will have an increased chance to find hidden items on the map, an innate ability
        normally set to Sothe and Heather.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>As of version 2.2.2</b>, bases of the slot are reordered to better reflect the new character. For example,
        Ike's highest personal base is in STR. If he were to be randomized into Soren, whose highest personal base
        is MAG, then Ike's slot will have a MAG base equal to vanilla Ike's STR base stat.
    </p>

    <h4>Include enemy characters</h4>
    <p>
        This selection throws a couple of major antagonists into the pool of possible playable units.
        This also changes those antagonists, so whether or not you selected randomize bosses, the enemies
        listed here will have their classes modified.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jarod</li>
        <li>Ludveck</li>
        <li>Septimus</li>
        <li>Valtome</li>
        <li>Numida</li>
        <li>Izuka</li>
        <li>Hetzel</li>
        <li>Lekain</li>
        <li>Levail</li>
        <li>Zelgius</li>
        <li>Dheginsea*</li>
        <li>Black Knight* ** (yes, both him and zelgius, shut up)</li>
        <li>Sephiran* (yes, him and lehran, they're totally different people i promise)</li>
        <li>Ashera* **</li>
    </ul>
    <p>* does not have their class changed</p>
    <p>** only when player class randomization is selected</p>

    <p>
        "Wait!" you might ask, "These characters don't have growth rates, what will happen when my units get
        changed into them?" Well, that's a great question, thanks for asking it. Each of these bosses has been given growth rates for
        the purposes of random recruitment. You can see what they are in the following table:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>HP</th> <th>STR</th> <th>MAG</th> <th>SKL</th> <th>SPD</th> <th>LCK</th> <th>DEF</th> <th>RES</th> </tr>
        <tr> <td>lehran</td><td>60</td><td>0</td><td>70</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>75</td><td>15</td><td>55</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>jarod</td><td>55</td><td>35</td><td>35</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>50</td><td>55</td><td>20</td></tr>

        <tr> <td>septimus</td><td>55</td><td>40</td><td>25</td><td>30</td><td>25</td><td>40</td><td>50</td><td>20</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>valtome</td><td>40</td><td>15</td><td>60</td><td>25</td><td>35</td><td>65</td><td>10</td><td>70</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>numida</td><td>45</td><td>25</td><td>50</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>65</td><td>20</td><td>55</td></tr>

        <tr> <td>zelgius</td><td>60</td><td>40</td><td>15</td><td>50</td><td>45</td><td>55</td><td>30</td><td>20</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>dheginsea</td><td>95</td><td>60</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>50</td><td>25</td><td>50</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>sephiran</td><td>70</td><td>10</td><td>75</td><td>25</td><td>25</td><td>60</td><td>15</td><td>60</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>blackknight</td><td>75</td><td>55</td><td>10</td><td>50</td><td>15</td><td>55</td><td>45</td><td>15</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>ashera</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td><td>50</td></tr>

    </table>

    <h4>Keep Vanilla Classes</h4>
    <p>
        This will keep the classes of the vanilla slot, no matter what character is randomized into that slot.
        For example, if Micaiah's slot is randomized into Nolan, the first unit you obtain will still be a lightmage,
        even though it is Nolan's face, growths, and affinity.
        For obvious reasons, this does not work with random classes.
    </p>

    <h4>Set as Ike/Micaiah/Elincia</h4>
    <p>
        With this, you can select the characters to replace Ike, Micaiah, and Elincia. The character selected to replace
        Ike will be the lord, will fight BK, and must land the killing blow to win the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the limitations listed in the class randomization section, there is a list of classes that Ike
        cannot be or else there is a chance for softlocks. If you attempt to select one of these, the randomizer will
        inform you of the problem and will not randomize until you change it.
    </p>

    <h4>Randomize Affinity</h4>
    <p>
        Not much to discuss here. Randomizes the affinity of each playable character (sans BK). Affinities
        change support bonuses as well as give a unit small buffs when their affinity matches the map's
        affinity. More information can be found <a href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Affinity#Path_of_Radiance_and_Radiant_Dawn">HERE</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Randomize Biorhythm</h4>
    <p>
        Assigns a random biorhythm type to each playable character (sans BK). Biorhythm affects a bunch
        of small aspects of a unit, including hit/dodge rate. More information can be found <a href="https://serenesforest.net/radiant-dawn/characters/biorhythm/">HERE</a>.

    <h4>Randomize Skills</h4>
    <p>
        Randomizes each skill attached to playable characters (sans BK). The number of skills will depend on the user
        inputs. The list of possible skills can
        be found in the <a href="#randskills">appendix</a> of this document.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a unit obtains a skill normally
        locked to the character it starts on (ie Vigilance, Glare), it will be locked to the new unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a unit obtains a skill not normally allowed to be on their class (ie Blood Tide on Soldier),
        it will still work. However, if you remove the skill, you will not be able to reassign it to that unit.
    </p>

    <h4>Characters keep same # of Skills + modifier</h4>
    <p>
        Each character will gain a number of random skills equal to the number of skills they start with in the vanilla
        game, with the addition of whatever number you put in the modifier box. For example, Micaiah normally starts with 1
        skill, but Ena starts with 4. If you select this option with a modifier of 1, Micaiah will start with 2 random skills
        and Ena 5. Each character can have a maximum of 6 skills.
    </p>
    <h4>Characters have set # of Skills = modifier</h4>
    <p>
        No matter how many skills a character may normally have in the base game, this option will give all player characters
        the same number of skills, equal to the number you place in the modifier box.
    </p>

    <h4>Give all Characters/Laguz Paragon</h4>
    <p>
        Replaces the final skill of each character with Paragon. If a character has less than the maximum number
        of skills, Paragon will not overwrite any of their original or randomized skills. You can also limit this to
        modify Laguz characters only.
    </p>

    <h4>All Dragons can use Pool Skills</h4>
    <p>Blood tide, white pool, night wave can all be equipped to a dragon regardless of color with this setting.</p>

    <h4>All Classes can use all Skills</h4>
    <p>This setting removes all restrictions for skill placement. Beorc can have Laguz skills, mages can have Imbue, etc.</p>


    <h4>Randomize Skill Capacity</h4>
    <p>
        This modifies the necessary capacity of all skills in the game, including the mastery skills of T3
        classes, like Astra. Each skill will have a chance to stay unmodified, a large chance to be +/- 5 capacity,
        a slighly less chance of being +/- 10 capacity, and a very small chance of being +/- 15 capacity.
    </p>

    <h4>Give All Enemies Skills</h4>
    <p>
        This option will give all enemies, generic and bosses alike, random skills up to the selected number.
        The maximum number of skills for enemies is three.
    </p>

    <h4>Give Bosses 1 More Skill</h4>
    <p>
        Does exactly what it says. If you selected two for enemy skills, this option will give bosses three skills.
        If you select this without selecting the enemy skill option, this will give each boss one random skill.
    </p>

    <h2 id="shop">Shop</h2>

    <h4>Randomize Shops</h4>
    <p>
        This selection changes the contents of the armory/shop in each chapter that normally has one. The
        possible items include weapons, skills, and stat boosters.
    </p>
    <p>Healing items (ie Herbs), promotion items, and healing staves are twice as likely to appear as other items.</p>
    <h4>Force Basic Items at Each Shop</h4>
    <p>This selection will force all shops to contain iron weapons, herbs, olivi grass, and heal staves</p>

    <h4>Randomize Bargains</h4>
    <p>
        This will randomize the bargain selection of each shop, where each item is a single-purchase item. The
        weights allow you to better customize what you may see in the bargain section. A higher number means that
        it is more likely that an item of that type is in the bargains. Setting a value to zero will insure that
        you will never see an item of that type in the bargains.
    </p>

    <h4>Randomize Forge</h4>
    <p>
        I've gotta admit, I'm pretty proud of this one. It took me forever to figure out how to do it, but now
        each weapon in the forge can be randomized, and they change each chapter as well. Under "Iron Sword",
        there can be a Windsword, or a Brave Axe, or even Thani! Some clarifications:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>This does not change which chapters have a forge.</li>
        <li>
            This does not modify the number of forging items there are per chapter. As normal, Part 1 will have
            less forging options than part 4.
        </li>
        <li>
            The weapon models are based off of items that can normally be forged, so a forged Killing Edge
            may look like a Steel Sword.
        </li>
        <li>
            The categories of the forges cannot be changed. This is due to how Radiant Dawn forges work so it
            will not be fixed in the future. A Brave Lance may be under Magic > Wind or Axe > Steel, but the
            categories do not affect the weapon whatsoever.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Just like the bargain section, this option has weights to allow you to further customize what you may
        find in the forge. A higher number means that it is more likely that a weapon of that type can be found
        in the forge. Setting a value to zero will insure that you will never see that weapon in the forge.
    </p>

    <h4>Lower Price of Laguz Gem</h4>
    <p>Lowers price to 2k per use so it is more manageable to purchase if it shows up in the shop.</p>
    <h4>Sellable Promotion Items / Satori Sign</h4>
    <p>
        These items are otherwise useless if you don't have a beorc/laguz to use them on, so you might
        as well make some money off of them. Like anything else, these sell for half of their purchase price.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenge Runs and Patches</h3>
    <p>
        These are for the purposes of increasing the difficulty of or augmenting the base game. If you do not
        wish to use any of the randomizing elements, many of these can be found in a separate "Challenge Patcher"
        program.
    </p>

    <h4>0% Growths</h4>
    <p>
        For those who are unaware, a levelup with zero stat gains is impossible in FE10: even with
        zero growths across all stats, a unit will still gain a single point in a random stat upon level up.
        That is... until now! This selection nullifies the section of code that calculates the random stat up,
        thus allowing you to (finally) play the 0% run of Radiant Dawn that you've always wanted!
    </p>

    <h4>Negative Growths</h4>
    <p>
        For the real masochists. Level ups lower stats instead of increasing them with the same chance as
        normal, based on growth rates. This works with random growths, too, for a really "fun" time.
    </p>

    <h4>Ironman Mode</h4>
    <p>
        Historically, Radiant Dawn has been a difficult game to Ironman due to the fact that countless
        character deaths can cause gameovers throughout the game. This is in direct opposition to most other
        FE games, which continue no matter who dies as long as your Lord is alive. This option is my attempt
        to remedy this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't know what an "Ironman" playthrough is, it is simply a run without any resets. If a
        character dies, you continue without them. If your lord dies and you gameover, you lose the run. It's
        sort of a self-imposed challenge to make strategy games like FE or XCOM more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you select this option, here is the extensive list of all characters who will cause a gameover
        if they die:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Micaiah</dt>
        <dd>- always</dd>
        <dt>Ike</dt>
        <dd>- always</dd>
        <dt>Laura</dt>
        <dd>- Part 1 Chapter 2</dd>
        <dt>Aran</dt>
        <dd>- Part 1 Chapter 3</dd>
        <dt>Elincia</dt>
        <dd>- Part 2 Prologue</dd>
        <dd>- Part 2 Endgame</dd>
        <dd>- Part 3 Chapter 10</dd>
        <dt>Lucia</dt>
        <dd>- Part 2 Chapter 2</dd>
        <dt>Geoffrey</dt>
        <dd>- Part 2 Chapter 3</dd>
        <dd>- Part 2 Endgame</dd>
        <dd>- Part 3 Chapter 9</dd>
        <dt>Ranulf</dt>
        <dd>- Part 3 Prologue</dd>
        <dd>- Part 3 Chapter 4</dd>
        <dt>Skrimir</dt>
        <dd>- Part 3 Prologue</dd>
        <dt>Tibarn</dt>
        <dd>- Part 3 Chapter 11</dd>
        <dd>- Part 4 Chapter 2</dd>
        <dd>- Part 4 Chapter 5</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        While this list is still long compared to other FE titles, most of the listed characters that can't
        die are due to either map objectives or the fact that they are your "Lord" for that chapter.
    </p>

    <h4>Fire Emblem: Choose my Tower Units</h4>
    <p>
        An ultimate challenge for Radiant Dawn randomizations. This selection will randomly select 10 units not
        usually required for endgame and set them to be required, filling up all 16 slots and not allowing you
        to choose any units other than the heron. Will you have an all-star line-up, or will you be stuck with
        Astrid and Lyre? Maybe you get Haar, but he's randomized so badly that he's garbage! Either way, if you
        select this you'll have to use whoever the program decides.
    </p>
    <p>
        The units will be listed in the outputlog, so you can see who they are before you get to the tower.
        If you randomized recruitment, the units listed correspond with their <i>slot</i>, not the character. If
        you are confused about what that means, check out the section on <a href="#recruit">Recruitment</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If used in tandem with "Kurth & Ena Not Required for Tower", the program will select 12 units instead, and Kurth
        and Ena are added to the list of possible units.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one of the selected units dies before you reach the tower, their slot will be open and you are free
        to choose anybody to replace them (but where's the fun in that??)
    </p>

    <h4>LM73's Custom Class Patch</h4>
    <p>
        This selection adds multiple custom physical/magical classes to diversify the class pool of the game further.
        These classes are added to player random class pools. At the moment, enemies cannot be randomized into
        these classes. If you select this without randomizing
        classes, some playable characters will have their classes changed to custom classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        These classes do not promote from vanilla classes. The only exception is that Thieves will promote into
        Tricksters instead of Rogues. Otherwise, the only way to obtain them with random
        classes is for one of your units to directly randomize into one of them.
    </p>
    <p>The following table lists the new custom classes added by this selection:</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Name</th> <th>Weapons(Max Rank)</th> <th>Promotes to</th> <th>Character</th> </tr>

        <tr><td>Son of Ashnard</td> <td>Sword(A), Axe(SS), Fire(S), Thunder(S), Wind(SS)</td> <td>n/a</td> <td>n/a</td> </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Furthermore, the following vanilla classes gain extra weapon types:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd>- Reavers/Assassins can use bows(S)</dd>
        <dd>- Queens can use Light(SS)</dd>
        <dd>- Clerics/Valkyries can use Wind(S/SS)</dd>

    <h4>LM73's Magic Patch</h4>

    <h3>Make Hardmode Great Again</h3>
    <p>
        These selections return settings that were stripped from the game for hardmode. While some of these
        removals actually changed the game, requiring different strategies (weapon triangle), others did
        nothing but artificially "increase" the difficulty (enemy ranges). Seriously, who thought that was
        a good idea? Anyway, many people have asked for a way to re-introduce these settings to hardmode,
        so here it is!
    </p>

    <h3>Miscellaneous Randomizations</h3>
    <p>Here lie those settings who I wasn't sure where else to place.</p>

    <h4>Randomize Event Items</h4>
    <p>
            Changes all items obtained from villages, chests, treasure, base conversations, and events. Some events
            are unchanged, including obtaining Amiti and Ragnell. Treasure spots can be found <a href="https://serenesforest.net/radiant-dawn/miscellaneous/hidden-treasure/">HERE</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Don't Randomize Promotion Items</h4>
    <p>This selection will prevent all promotion items given through events from being randomized.</p>

    <h4>Randomize Movement</h4>
    <p>
        A long-asked for addition to the randomizer, now you can randomize the amount of movement each class
        has. Each class will be assigned a random movement between the selected minimum and maximum values. In
        order to prevent softlocks due to tiles such as swamp and ledges that persist throughout the game, this
        option will also reduce the movement cost of such tiles to be equal to the selected minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you were to select a minimum movement of 3, the cost for thieves to cross a swamp
        will be unchanged, as it is normally 2, but the cost for an armored unit to cross a swamp, normally 4,
        will be reduced to 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will not change movement costs that are set to be impassible, such as mounted units unable to
        climb ledges. However, if this option is selected alongside <b>Horse Parkour</b>, the movement cost
        will be lowered from 6 to the selected minimum.
    </p>

    <h4>Randomize Promotion</h4>
    <p>
        This selection will randomize the promotion path of each class that is able to promote.
        Druids will still require a Master Crown to promote. Classes that are usually not in promotional
        paths, ie Queen, are able to become part of a promotional path. No two classes are able to
        promote into the same class.
    </p>
    <h5>Force Physical->Physical, Magic->Magic</h5>
    <p>
        For anybody desiring a less intense random promotion. This selection will make sure that
        promotion paths will keep physical and magical classes separate, so you don't have armor knights
        promoting into bishops.
    </p>


    <hr>
    <h2 id="qol">Quality of Life</h2>
    <p>
        These are various small changes, most of which are either QoL changes or softlock prevention.
        Each of these settings has a purpose, and most often that purpose is "let's make this less dumb and
        actually fun to play."
    </p>

    <h4>Skill Changes</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Give Ike Nihil Scroll</dt>
        <dd>
            - Ike normally obtains Nihil upon promotion to Vangaurd, but if his class is randomized it is
            not guaranteed that the player will obtain Nihil at all, which makes endgame exceptionally difficult</dt>
        <dt>Give Beast Laguz Canto</dt>
        <dd>
            - lions, cats, tigers, and wolves will now be able to finish their movement
            after an action
        </dd>
        <dt>Give Dragon Laguz Canto</dt>
        <dd>
            - red, white, and black dragons will be able to finish their movement after an action
        </dd>

        <dd>- turns an unused item into a skill scroll that teaches Formshift to any Laguz</dd>
        <dd>- adds Formshift scroll to random event items and shop</dd>
        <dd>- Formshift can now be removed from royal laguz and turned into a Formshift scroll</dd>
        <dt>Replace Whisper's Bane with Lethality</dt>
        <dd>- Bane is a terrible skill. This gets rid of it and replaces it with Assassin's Lethality</dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Increased Usefulness</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Give Knives Higher Crit</dt>
        <dd>- adds 5% extra crit rate to all knives and daggers</dd>
        <dt>Horse Parkour</dt>
        <dd>- allows horses to cross rivers and ledges for the cost of six movement</dd>
        <dd>- this allows Ike and Ranulf to be randomized into horse classes</dd>
        <dt>Druid/Summoner use Fire Magic</dt>
        <dd>- without shop randomization, early druids may find dark magic quite scarce.</dt>
        <dd>- gives druids starting D rank in fire</dt>
        <dd>- gives summoners starting B rank in fire</dt>
        <dt>Light Sage/Priestess use Dark Magic</dt>
        <dd>- to diversify micaiah's classes more from Bishop/Priest</dt>
        <dd>- gives light sage starting C rank in dark</dt>
        <dd>- gives light priestess starting B rank in dark</dt>
        <dt>Beefy Tormod Squad</dt>
        <dd>
            - to offset their terrible availability, Tormod and Co will be considered a t3 beorc for the
            purposes of randomization
        </dd>
        <dd>- Tormod starts as a firearchsage without random classes</dd>
        <dd>- Vika and Maurim gain stat boosts</dd>
        <dd>- they are not considered a laguz royal if randomized into a laguz</dd>
        <dt>Mist Starts with Holy Crown</dt>
        <dd>
            - comes in starting inventory
            - normal holy crown is now randomized with Random Event Items
        </dd>
        <dt>Druid Starts with Master Crown</dt>
        <dd>
            - comes in starting inventory
            - druid still can't promote via exp
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Softlock Prevention</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Change 1-5 Enemy AI</dt>

        <dd>- causes the enemies near Fiona to not attack immediately</dt>
        <dd>- prevents Fiona from dying turn 1</dt>
        <dt>Remove BK's Imbue</dt>
        <dd>- BK no longer heals each turn, making him easier to kill in the tower</dt>
        <dd>- this allows Ike to be randomized into magic/rogue classes
        <dt>Ike Fights BK with Power of Friendship</dt>
        <dd>- moves one of the starting positions in 4-Eb to above the barrier, next to Ike</dt>
        <dd>- good safeguard in case Ike gets poorly randomized and can't defeat BK himself</dt>
        <dd>- this allows Ike to be randomized into magic/rogue classes
    </dl>

    <h4>Crimean Softlock Prevention Initiative</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Reduce Stats of Part 2 Enemies</dt>

        <dt>Heather Starts Blue</dt>
        <dd>
            - Heather will no longer be a green unit on chapter 2-1, allowing the user to better control where she goes
            (and prevent her untimely demise)
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Other Helpful Changes</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Lots of BEXP</dt>
        <dd>- chapters will output an increased amount of BEXP for completion</dd>

    <a href="#details">How it Works</a>
    <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>
    <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>


    <h3>How do I promote Ike/Micaiah/Sothe?</h3>
    <p>
        All event promotions are turned off. Now these three promote like any other unit,
        either with a Master Seal/Crown or at level 21.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>My druid capped at level 21! Isn't he supposed to promote?</h3>
    <p>
        Due to the druid being an enemy-only class, the game does not allow it to promote
        using exp or bexp. You must use a Master Crown to promote to summoner.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>If I randomize classes and Ike can't use Ragnell, how do I defeat Ashera?</h3>
    <p>
        Ike (or whoever replaces him with random recruitment) must land the final blow on Ashera,
        regardless of (blessed) weapon.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>WiiBaFu is throwing an error when I try to extract my rom!</h3>
    <p>
        Make sure your copy of Radiant Dawn is in .iso format. If it is a .iso.nkit, you can follow
        instructions <a href="https://youtu.be/lKYl1YqqTsQ">HERE</a> and in the comments of that youtube
        video to convert it into a .iso, or you could just find a .iso formatted copy online if that is too
        much work.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your copy of Radiant Dawn is a .iso and you still get this error, you may be trying to
        extract your ISO to a location that already has an extracted ISO. WiiBaFu seems to not like that,
        but it doesn't do a great job of informing the user.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Why can't my units be Bandits?</h3>
    <p>
        For some reason, Radiant Dawn removed the Berserker class, so Bandits do not have a promotion
        path. I could probably make them promote into Warriors, but at the end of the day all that will do
        is double the chances that the Dawn Brigade is filled with axe users.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>
        The randomizer produces an error that tells me that it can't find assets/CharacterInfo.csv,
        but it's in the correct folder!
    </h3>
    <p>
        Make sure that you did not move/rename any files in the randomizer. If everything is exactly
        as it was when you unzipped it, try running the .exe as administrator.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>
        The randomizer produces an error that says "Cannot find file [something something]/temp/script/[name].cmb"
    </h3>
    <p>
        This is a known issue with the script editor; make sure the filepath does not contain any 
        non-English characters. It also would be best if the path is on the C: drive, not an external drive.
    </p>


    <br>
    <h3>Where do I get an ISO?</h3>
    <p>
        I cannot tell you how to find this, other than the internet <i>cue Timmy Turner</i>.
        <b>Please do not ask for this on the Discord, either.</b>
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>I keep getting the error message "Cannot find DATA/sys/main.dol"</h3>
    <p>Make sure that the folder you're selecting with the randomizer is DATA/files.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Do the randomized games run on console/mobile?</h3>
    <p>
        There have been varying reports of people having no problems, and other people having
        unskippable crashes.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Why are some of my units T-posing?</h3>
    <p>
        A few units on specific chapters attempt to use their default models for some reason. I
        am not sure why, all I know is that if a unit dies while T-posing, it'll crash the game.
        So if you notice T-posing, it may be in your best interest to set the animations to map-only
        for the rest of that chapter.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>I selected Ironman mode but Aran dying still caused a game over, what's up?</h3>
    <p>This is a known glitch that I am unable to fix. After being recruited on his debut chapter (1-3), Aran dying will result in a game over. If he dies as a red unit, this does not count as a game over. This is the only game over that is not due to a victory condition/lord dying. For a full list of game overs in Ironman mode, check out the README under "Ironman mode"</p>

    <br>
    <h3>How to I check my growths after randomizing?</h3>
    <p>There is a new file in the randomizer folder called "outputlog.htm" that appears after a successful randomization!</p>

    <p>
        Depending on what settings you select for your randomization, various changes are made to the
        game by default in order to prevent softlocking or crashes. These changes are not listed under
        <i>Other Changes</i> on the user panel of the randomizer.
